A curated list of full-fledged examples backed by `slight` and SpiderLightning

## Start a `slight` Chat!

This app uses Synadia service, a managed NATS service. https://www.synadia.com/

To try out the slight chat, you'll need installed:
- `nats`,
- `rust`,
- the appropriate WebAssembly targets, and
- `slight v0.4.1` itself.

To run the front-end, do: `make serve` from the root of this repository. Next, run `make run` to start up the back-end.
